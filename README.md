## Plan for School Year 2024-2025:

**Level Groups**: In principle there will be 4 groups for students from grades 4 to 12 for the 2024-2025 school year:
- *Group 1 (G1) for beginners*: absolute no prerequisite is required for joining this group. All students will learn basic approach to mathematics and problem solving.
- *Group 2 (G2) for intermediate students*, who have an understanding of basic mathematical concepts and obtained a few skills to solve math problem. They are capable of writing their own solution to a given problem.
- *Group 3 (G3) for advanced students*, who are ready to go on the track to master enough knowledge and skills to solve any math problems in school and willing to go the distance for national competitions.
- *Group 4 (G4) for olympiad students*, who are about to be ready or already proven themselves in competitions and now preparing for upcoming and new challenges.

**Team organizations:**
- Students when registered will be assigned into teams.
- Team standings are calculated based on the members' results in both mandatory and optional programs.

**Fundamental program**:
This is the *mandatory program* for every level, every week a 60-minute seminar on a topic on Sunday, then a home assignment for about 5 hours (based on the content of the seminar on the topic in 5 days), then a 90-minutes test on the following Saturday In short, every week from Sunday to Saturday, students need about 7 hours, equivalent to 1 hour/day.

|  Sunday |    Monday   |   Tuesday   |  Wednesday  |   Thursday  |    Friday   | Saturday |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| Seminar |   Homework  |   Homework  |   Homework  |   Homework  |   Homework  |   Test   |
|   1 hr  | minimum 1hr | minimum 1hr | minimum 1hr | minimum 1hr | minimum 1hr |  1.5 hrs |


*Note: This year's program is different from other years in that it does not go deep into each individual math topic, but each week students will have content that requires focused thinking, reasoning, reading comprehension, and applying the content learned in the seminar to work on assignments, then applying that for the test at the end of the week. This will prepare students to be ready for tests, competitions, etc at all times.*

**Enrichment program**: 
This is an *optional program* to help certain students to study more deeply and work with teammates, at the beginning of the month a number of challenges are issued. The members of in a team will work together solve and submit solutions at the end of the month. Teams submitted great solutions will be invited for presentation in seminars. It is expected that participating student needs to invest an additional 7 hours/week for this program.

*Note: Solving monthly challenges is to be able to invest in deep thinking on difficult problems, on topics that require extensive reading and deep understanding. One of the key aspects is learning to work as a team.*

**Individual Championships**:
Based on weekly tests, monthly submissions, and other schedule tests.

**Team Championships**:
Based on weekly tests, monthly submissions, and other schedule tests.

**[Purple Comet Math Meet](https://purplecomet.org)**:
All teams have a chance to participate in this great competition.

*Note: Students who are not familiar or have not successfully passed the Introductory Curriculum Level 5 Test are advised to learn and take the tests. More information about the ICLTs can be found [here](https://mccyouthclub.wixsite.com/home/post/the-first-introductory-curriculum-level-test-iclt-this-year-22nd-oct-22).*

**Entrance Tests**:
- Students registering for level G1 do not have to take the entrance test.
- For students registering for level G2-G3-G4: There are two entrance test days on August 24 and August 31, 90 minutes for each test. Students can register different levels for the tests.

**Acceptance**:
- Students registering for level G1 are automatically admitted. Students registering for levels G2-G3-G4 but failed all of the tests taken can be admitted to level G1.
- Students registered and succeed the tests (for levels G2-G3-G4) can be admitted any of the levels of the successful tests.
