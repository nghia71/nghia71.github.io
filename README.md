### **C.3 Ongoing companion for every math leaners**: [Learning Problem Solving, Volume 3](./lps/LPS-Vol3-3.1-Ongoing.pdf)

<span style="color:red">*Last update on August 31, 2023.*</span>

Unlike the other book, this book is an ongoing online book, which means that it is updated frequently and available online to the members of the club. 

A smaller set of problems are to help the young contestants to find their footing at the beginning of the journey. A significant number of problems in the book are from the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO), National Math Olympiads, and other Math Competitions from countries and regions around the world.

Thousands of problems are organized into over 40 chapters of 7 parts: Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, Number Theory, Logic, Chess, and Coding. In each chapter, which focuses on certain topics, some examples are discussed in details, sometimes with multiple solutions. 

In each chapters, there are examples at lower difficulty for juniors or seniors without extensive mathematical knowledge or skills. Readers will find examples at olympiad level and additional problems. The students shall attempt to solve the examples first, before consult with the solution(s). In some chapters, related theories are noted at the beginning, some are accompanied with proofs, and additional colloraries. They are by no mean complete. The students are advised and encouraged to learn from other sources, whenever possible.
