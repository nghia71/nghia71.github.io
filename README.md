## PRELIMINARY Result of Entrance Test (Day 1 & 2)

### How to read the result:

1. If you have done one test, you got one line. If you have done multiple test, you got multiple lines: the one started with your ID and all the ones without until the next student.
For example:

*Adelina Mai Linh Luu has done one test (G2), Albert Dinh-Le has done two tests (G3 and G4), and An Nguyen has done one test (G3):*

|  ID  |          Name          |   Program   | Country | Level | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 | Total |
|:----:|:----------------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|
|  S77 | Adelina Mai Linh Luu   | Fundamental |    CA   |   G2  | 20 | 20 |  6 |  2 |  6 |   54  |
| S101 | Albert Dinh-Le         | Enrichment  |    FR   |   G3  | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 14 |   94  |
|      |                        |             |         |   G4  |    | 20 | 20 |    | 20 |   60  |
|  S84 | An Nguyen              | Enrichment  |    UK   |   G3  |  4 | 20 |  2 | 12 | 20 |   58  |

2. **If you got 50+ points**, you are accepted to that level group. If you pass more, you can be accepted to the highest level of them.
*It is your choice which level do you want to attend.* In the example above *Adelina Mai Linh Luu is accepted to level G2*, *Albert Dinh-Le has a choice for G3 or G4,* and *An Nguyen is accepted to G3.* Be careful when making the choice. It should be the one that *you are comfortable with.*

3. **If you got under 50 points**, you can be accepted to G1.

## Plan for School Year 2024-2025:

**Level Groups**: In principle there will be 4 groups for students from grades 4 to 12 for the 2024-2025 school year:
- *Group 1 (G1) for beginners*: absolute no prerequisite is required for joining this group. All students will learn basic approach to mathematics and problem solving.
- *Group 2 (G2) for intermediate students*, who have an understanding of basic mathematical concepts and obtained a few skills to solve math problem. They are capable of writing their own solution to a given problem.
- *Group 3 (G3) for advanced students*, who are ready to go on the track to master enough knowledge and skills to solve any math problems in school and willing to go the distance for national competitions.
- *Group 4 (G4) for olympiad students*, who are about to be ready or already proven themselves in competitions and now preparing for upcoming and new challenges.

**Team organizations:**
- Students when registered will be assigned into teams.
- Team standings are calculated based on the members' results in both mandatory and optional programs.

**Fundamental program**:
This is the *mandatory program* for every level, every week a 60-minute seminar on a topic on Sunday, then a home assignment for about 5 hours (based on the content of the seminar on the topic in 5 days), then a 90-minutes test on the following Saturday In short, every week from Sunday to Saturday, students need about 7 hours, equivalent to 1 hour/day.

|  Sunday |    Monday   |   Tuesday   |  Wednesday  |   Thursday  |    Friday   | Saturday |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| Seminar |   Homework  |   Homework  |   Homework  |   Homework  |   Homework  |   Test   |
|   1 hr  | minimum 1hr | minimum 1hr | minimum 1hr | minimum 1hr | minimum 1hr |  1.5 hrs |


*Note: This year's program is different from other years in that it does not go deep into each individual math topic, but each week students will have content that requires focused thinking, reasoning, reading comprehension, and applying the content learned in the seminar to work on assignments, then applying that for the test at the end of the week. This will prepare students to be ready for tests, competitions, etc at all times.*

**Enrichment program**: 
This is an *optional program,* offering for students G2, G3, and G4 only, to help them to study more deeply and work with teammates
- In every 6 weeks, a number of challenges are issued. The members of in a team will work together solve and submit solutions at deadlines. Teams submitted great solutions will be invited for presentation in seminars.
- In addition, the team will be participating a team test in every 6 weeks. Everybody should work together online during the 90-minute test and submit together the solution.
It is expected that participating student needs to invest an additional 7 hours/week for this program.

*Note: Solving monthly challenges is to be able to invest in deep thinking on difficult problems, on topics that require extensive reading and deep understanding. Working together during a 90-minute test requires even better collaboration. Both are the key aspects of learning to work as a team.*

**Individual Championships**:
Based on weekly tests, monthly submissions, and other schedule tests.

**Team Championships**:
Based on weekly tests, monthly submissions, and other schedule tests.

**[Purple Comet Math Meet](https://purplecomet.org)**:
All teams have a chance to participate in this great competition.

&nbsp;

*Note: Students who are not familiar or have not successfully passed the Introductory Curriculum Level 5 Test are advised to learn and take the tests. More information about the ICLTs can be found [here](https://mccyouthclub.wixsite.com/home/post/the-first-introductory-curriculum-level-test-iclt-this-year-22nd-oct-22).*
