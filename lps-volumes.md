These books constitute the Learning Problem Solving series from Math Club & Competitions (MCC) (a.k.a Math and Chess Club in Ottawa.) 

Students of the club are advised to use the book to learn, practice, and prepare for the clubâ€™s House Championship as well as math competitions.

The problems and their solutions are from various sources. Thus, these are open books with all rights reserved by the authors of the problems and solutions. No attempt should be made to reproduce or commercialize any part of any of these books.

Have fun, learn and enjoy!

- Probability

&nbsp;

### **Club competitions**: [Learning Problem Solving, Volume 2](./lps/LPS-Vol-2-1.0-Final.pdf)

Over 400 problems collected from some competitions of the club during the year 2020.

- Summer semester - 14 weeks, each with a weekly team contest and a set of problems of the week
- Fall semester - 3 months, each with monthly team contest and a set of problems of the months

### **Ongoing companion for every math learners**: [Learning Problem Solving, Volume 3](./lps/LPS-Vol3-3.1-Ongoing.pdf)

Unlike the other book, this book is an ongoing online book, which means that it is updated frequently and available online to the members of the club. 

A smaller set of problems are to help the young contestants to find their footing at the beginning of the journey. A significant number of problems in the book are from the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO), National Math Olympiads, and other Math Competitions from countries and regions around the world.

Thousands of problems are organized into over 40 chapters of 7 parts: Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, Number Theory, Logic, Chess, and Coding. In each chapter, which focuses on certain topics, some examples are discussed in details, sometimes with multiple solutions. 

In each chapters, there are examples at lower difficulty for juniors or seniors without extensive mathematical knowledge or skills. Readers will find examples at olympiad level and additional problems. The students shall attempt to solve the examples first, before consult with the solution(s). In some chapters, related theories are noted at the beginning, some are accompanied with proofs, and additional corollaries. They are by no mean complete. The students are advised and encouraged to learn from other sources, whenever possible.

### **Companion for intermediate students**: [Learning Problem Solving, Toolbox](./lps/LPS-Tools.pdf)

- 10 Problem Solving Strategies
- 5 Principles: Invariance, Colouring, Pigeonhole, Extremal, and Induction Principles
- 10 Counting Techniques
