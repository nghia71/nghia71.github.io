## Introductory Curriculum Level Test (ICLT)

ICLT is an activity of Math, Chess, and Coding Club (MCC).
Students will follow the Introductory Curriculum of the Art of Problem Solving which is comprised of 71
chapters under 4 subject areas: Algebra, Counting and Probability, Number Theory and Geometry. 

Students are advised to order these books via Arts of Problem-Solving website. The curriculum is intended for students
from Grade 5-10 following the Canadian curriculum. Study should be rotated based on the 4 books, each
time covering a chapter from each book. 

A typical chapter will be comprised of theory, exercises, practice
problems and challenge problems. Students choose their own learning pace based on the amount of time
they can commit to the curriculum on a weekly basis. 

The following can serve as a guideline: (i) Basic: 3
hours/week = 30 mins/day x 6 days, (ii) Intermediate: 6 hours/week = 60 mins/day x 6 days, (iii) Advanced:
9 hours/week = 1.5 hour/day x 6 days.

There are several levels for the curriculum, each requires completion of a number of chapters from the
text books and successfully pass of completion test. The table below lists the levels and required chapters
from each text book.

Introductory Curriculum Level Test:
- All  start at 10:00 PM Eastern Time (EST) on a Saturday and lasts for 90 minutes.
- The test consists of 6 multiple-choice and 4 show-you-work problems. To answer each of 6
multiple-choice problems, you can select at most one choice among A, B, C, D, and E. For each of 4
show-you-work problems, you have to provide a complete solution in detail. If your solution uses any
diagram, please submit them too.
- Paper-based book, calculators are allowed. Computers are allowed for solving problem with coding. No
searching on Internet for ideas, hints, or solutions are allowed. No help from anyone is allowed. Be
honest.

Grading:
1. For a multiple-choice problem if you give a correct answer, you get 10 points. For an unanswered
problem, i.e., if you select no choice, you get 1 point. For a wrong answer, i.e., when you select
the wrong choice, you get 0 point.
2. For a show-you-work problem the total number of points can be earned is 10. For a complete
solution for each question of a show-you-work problem, you earn all available points for that
question. If your solution for that question is not correct, you may earn some but not all available
points for that question. The actual number of points to be awarded is based on the discretion of
the grading COs.
- Students, if not able to join the contest at the official designated time, are eligible to write at an earlier
time. They must contact the COs in time for arrangement. They must not discuss any of the received
contest problems with anyone until the official contest time passed.
- Qualification: The minimum number of points to pass the level test is 51.
