# T3 – Team Track Level 3

## 1. What it is / Who it’s for  
T3 is the stage where students train for **national olympiad-level problem solving**.  

Students work in **teams of 2** (teams of 3 only with approval) and face olympiad-style problems that require deep insight, creative synthesis, and rigorous proof writing.  

This track is for students who:  
- have completed T2 (or equivalent) with strong results,  
- are comfortable with multi-step, contest-level problems,  
- are motivated to push beyond AMC 10/12 toward national olympiads, and  
- can commit **6–7 hours per week**.  

The focus is on building stamina, learning advanced theorems and techniques, and practicing how to break down unfamiliar problems into solvable parts.

## 2. Curriculum  
Students in T3 follow the club's textbook: **_The Art of Mathematical Combat – Advanced Problem Solving for Olympians_**  

The curriculum emphasizes:  
- Deep exploration of algebra, number theory, combinatorics, and geometry at olympiad level,  
- Applying standard olympiad theorems and lemmas,  
- Structuring rigorous and complete proofs,  
- Learning advanced strategies for contest problem solving,  
- Reviewing and presenting team solutions for peer learning.  

Assignments and tests are longer, requiring sustained effort and creative problem-solving.

## 3. Timetable (32 weeks, 2 semesters)  
T3 runs on a **repeating 2-week cycle**. Each cycle blends new learning with review of the previous cycle’s test.  

- **Week 1**  
  (from the very first cycle)  
  - Begin new material: study assigned theory and examples.  
- Work on team assignments (Exercises 1-3) and submit by Sunday.  

  (from Cycle 2 onwards, i.e. starting Week 3)  
  - Monday: Official solutions of the assignment released.  
  - Official test solutions are released on Monday.  
  - Grading and feedback from the previous cycle’s test are shared (Monday–Thursday).  
  - Selected teams prepare on Friday and present their solutions on Sunday.  

- **Week 2**  
  - Work on team assignments (Exercises 4-6) and submit by Sunday.  
  - Monday: Official solutions of the assignment released.  
  - Teams carefully review solutions.  
  - Sunday: **Team Test** (4 problems, 150 minutes). One solution per problem is submitted jointly by the team.  

Over **32 weeks (16 cycles)**, teams cover about 16 chapters of the curriculum.

## 4. Testing Timeline  
- **Team Assignments**: submitted every 2 weeks.  
- **Team Tests**:  
  - 150 minutes, 4 olympiad-level problems.  
  - Register your test time here: [Registration for Team Tests](https://forms.gle/j4xapHha1oJiMviW9).  
  - Taken bi-weekly on Sunday.  
  - Test schedule available here: [Team Tracks (T1–2–3–4) – MCC 2025–2026 Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YTFjMTNlNGEyY2M3NjdjNGRlYjYzNTMwMTk4NzRlNmIwNDQxOGZjYTEzOWQ1ZTRiOWM5OGJjOWI3NWViMmFkMUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).  

- **Grading & Feedback**:  
  - All tests and assignments are graded with detailed comments.  
  - Selected teams present their solutions live at the Sunday session (or submit a pre-recorded video if both members are absent).

## 5. Targets  
By the end of T3, students should be able to:  
- Apply advanced theorems and strategies across algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics,  
- Construct rigorous and complete olympiad-style proofs,  
- Tackle unfamiliar problems by breaking them down into solvable steps,  
- Collaborate effectively under extended time constraints,  
- Present and explain olympiad-level solutions with clarity.  

Successful T3 students are prepared to advance to **T4**, where they will train at full international olympiad standards and contest endurance.
