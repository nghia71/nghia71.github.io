# T2 – Team Track Level 2

## 1. What it is / Who it’s for  
T2 is the next step in **collaborative contest training** after T1.  
Students work in **teams of 2** (teams of 3 only with approval) and face more demanding contest problems that require deeper reasoning and stronger teamwork.  
This track is for students who:  
- have completed T1 or I2 (or equivalent),  
- are comfortable with the basics of contest-style problem solving,  
- enjoy working with a partner to solve harder problems, and  
- can commit **5–7 hours per week**.  

The focus is on learning to connect multiple ideas in one solution, writing proofs with clarity, and preparing for problems comparable to AMC 8/10 and national contest qualifiers.

## 2. Curriculum  
Students in T2 follow the club's textbook: **_From Foundations to Foresight – Advancing Skills for Young Mathematicians_**  

The curriculum emphasizes:  
- Building foresight: anticipating different solution approaches,  
- Developing longer and more complex arguments,  
- Applying strategies across algebra, number theory, combinatorics, and geometry,  
- Strengthening proof-writing and logical structure.  

Assignments and tests move beyond step-by-step hints, requiring students to design their own strategies.

## 3. Timetable (32 weeks, 2 semesters)  
T2 runs on a **repeating 2-week cycle**. Each cycle blends new learning with review of the previous cycle’s test.  

- **Week 1**  
  (from the very first cycle)  
  - Begin new material: study assigned theory and examples.  
  - Work on team assignments and submit by Sunday.  

  (from Cycle 2 onwards, i.e. starting Week 3)  
  - Grading and feedback from the previous cycle’s test are shared (Monday–Thursday).  
  - Official test solutions are released on Monday.  
  - Selected teams prepare and present their solutions on Friday or Sunday.  
  - Begin new material: study assigned theory and examples.  
  - Work on team assignments and submit by Sunday.  

- **Week 2**  
  - Monday: Official solutions of the assignment released.  
  - Teams carefully review solutions.  
  - Saturday/Sunday: **Team Test** (4 problems, 120 minutes). One solution per problem is submitted jointly by the team.  

Over **32 weeks (16 cycles)**, teams cover about 16 chapters of the curriculum.

## 4. Testing Timeline  
- **Team Assignments**: submitted every 2 weeks.  
- **Team Tests**:  
  - 120 minutes, 4 problems.  
  - Register your test time here: [Registration for Team Tests](https://forms.gle/j4xapHha1oJiMviW9).  
  - Taken bi-weekly on Saturday or Sunday.  
  - Test schedule available here: [Team Tracks (T1–2–3–4) – MCC 2025–2026 Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YTFjMTNlNGEyY2M3NjdjNGRlYjYzNTMwMTk4NzRlNmIwNDQxOGZjYTEzOWQ1ZTRiOWM5OGJjOWI3NWViMmFkMUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).  

- **Grading & Feedback**:  
  - All tests and assignments are graded with comments.  
  - Selected teams present their solutions live at the Sunday session (or submit a pre-recorded video if both members are absent).

## 5. Targets  
By the end of T2, students should be able to:  
- Recognize patterns and connections across different topics,  
- Sustain longer, multi-step solutions with clear structure,  
- Write complete and logically sound proofs,  
- Work effectively as a team under time constraints,  
- Present and explain solutions with confidence.  

Successful T2 students are prepared to advance to **T3**, where they will face olympiad-level problems requiring deeper insight and creative synthesis.
