Welcome to the 2024 - 2025 School Year of the Math Club & Competitions!

**The second semester is from January 12 to June 15, 2025.**

Please read carefully the content below. If you have any personal question, send it directly the club. if you have any general question that might be concern of other students, send it to the mailing list.

### A. Level Groups

There are 4 level groups for students from grades 4 to 12:

| Level | a.k.a        | for whom?                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| G1    | beginners    | absolute no prerequisite is required for joining this group. All students will learn basic approach to mathematics and problem solving.                                      |
| G2    | intermediate | who have an understanding of basic mathematical concepts and obtained a few skills to solve math problem. They are capable of writing their own solution to a given problem. |
| G3    | advance      | who are ready to go on the track to master enough knowledge and skills to solve any math problems in school and willing to go the distance for national competitions.        |
| G4    | olympiad     | who are about to be ready or already proven themselves in competitions and now preparing for upcoming and new challenges.                                                    |

### B. Official Curriculum

The student will use the official 2024-2025 curriculum for to study. The curriculum is shared with club members only.

What part of the curriculum the student learns is based on his/her level group as follow:

| Level | Part                          |
|:-----:|:-----------------------------:|
|   G1  | Part II - Beginner Level      |
|   G2  | Part III - Intermediate Level |
|   G3  | Part IV - Advanced Level      |
|   G4  | Part V - Olympiad Level       |

### C. Programs

#### C.1. Fundamental program

In every week of the first 2 weeks of every 3-week cycle, the student attends:
- a 30-minute seminar on a topic on Sunday, then 
- practicing 30 minutes/day for 5 weekdays on home assignment from the content of the seminar, then 
- a 90-minutes test on the following Saturday.

In short, every week from Sunday to Saturday, students need about 0.5 + 0.5 x 5 + 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

All students up to level G2 are advised to learn the AoPS Curriculum. It would take 4-8 hours/week (1-2 hours per book). If you want a better progress, learn as much as possible from this curriculum.

#### C.2. Enrichment program

This is an *optional program,* offering for students G2, G3, and G4 only, to help them to study more deeply and work with teammates
- In every 3 weeks, the student attends a 120-minute lecture for some topic at multiple levels (G2-G4): theory, examples, tips, and tricks. A back-and-forth learning.
- At the end of the week, the teams will be participating a team contest to solve 20 problems in 90 minutes (full solutions).
Everybody should work together online during the test and submit together the solution.
It is expected that participating student needs to invest an additional 2.5 hours/week for this program.

Where the teams can find the Team Challenge in the curriculum: Part VI - Team Contests

#### C.3. Grading team submission

It is impossible to balance teams for a fair contest, especially when allowing self-organized teams to be formed.
We will use two different measures: (i) absolute score: and (2) relative score. Below is an example (not related anyhow to the current team compositions.)

*Assume that the team test containing 10 problems: 4 at G2 difficulty, 4 at G3, and 2 at G4. Each problem is worth of 10 points.*

*The team strength is the sum of the product of the numbers of each members at each difficulty (G2-3-4) multiply with a weight (1, 2, 3).*
For example Team T2 has a mix of 2 G2, 4 G3, and 0 G4 members, their team strength is: `2 * 1.0 + 4 * 2.0 = 10.`
Team T4 has 3 G2, 1 G3, and 1 G4 members, their team strength is: `3 * 1.0 + 1 * 2.0 + 1 * 3.0 = 8.`

*The absolute score is the sum of the points the team earn from solving the problem, without any modification by weight.*
For example Team T2 has solved of 3 G2, 4 G3, their absolute score is 70.
Team T4 has solved 3 G2, 2 G3, and 2 G4, their absolute score is also 70.

*For relative score is the the sum of the points the team earn from solving the problem weighted by the difficulties of the problems (1, 1.5, 2), then divided by their team strength.*
Team T2 has achieved `(3 * 1.0 + 4 * 1.5) * 10 / 10 = 9.`
Team T4 has achieved `(3 * 1.0 + 2 * 1.5  + 2 * 2.0) * 10 / 8 = 12.5.`

#### C.4. 3-week Cycles

The school calendar is divided into 3-week cycle.

Each cycle contains 3 sessions, each is intended to be within a week:
- In the first 2 weeks (for all students):
    + On Sunday (Lecture Day): attending to the lectures (see below about scheduled times).
    + From Monday to Friday: practicing what was learned on additional examples and problems. Note that all problems have accompanied solutions. Try solve by yourself before reading the solutions.
    + On Saturday (Individual Test Day): take an individual test and submit the solutions to assigned Google folder (see below about the scheduled times of the individual tests).
- In week 3 (for student attending enrichment program):
    + On Sunday (Lecture Day): attending to the team lecture.
    + On Saturday (Team Contest Day): Teams of students take a Team Test together with their team members. Each team submits a single set of solutions.

Above, you can see that periods when the submissions will be graded and reviewed.

#### [C.5. Lecture Times](#c5-lecture-times)

Use **[this link](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=2193733,2078025,1857910,127,12,14,5,6,7,8&h=8&date=2025-1-11&sln=7-9&hf=2&c=1838)** to see what time in your timezone corresponds to the times in other zones.

Each seminar lasts for 30 minutes. The timezone for each student is on the list of all admitted students:

| Level |               Time      |
|:-----:|:-----------------------:|
|   G1  | 07:00 AM - 07:30 AM PST |
|   G2  | 07:30 AM - 08:00 AM PST |
|   G3  | 08:00 AM - 08:30 AM PST |
|   G4  | 08:30 AM - 09:00 PM PST |

![Seminar Times](./img/seminar-time-24-25-SM1.png)

Zoom links to each of the seminars will be provided.

#### C.6. Test Times

A Google folder is going to be shared for all students. This is going to be used for the whole semester to  share all test problems.
For any week, the test problems will be available from Saturday 0:00 AM to Sunday 11:59 PM.

All submissions must be uploaded to individual or team folders.
