# [I2 â€“ Individual Track Level 2](#i2--individual-track-level-2)

## 1. What it is / Who itâ€™s for  
I2 is the continuation of I1, for students who already have a basic foundation in mathematical problem solving and want to advance further.  
It is intended for independent learners who prefer a self-paced approach, without live lectures or teammates.  
Students are expected to commit about **0.5â€“1 hour per day, 5 days per week** (~3â€“4 hours per week).  
This track is suitable for motivated students who can work steadily through more challenging material.

## 2. Curriculum  
Students in I2 continue with the **Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) Introductory Curriculum**:  
- Introduction to Algebra  
- Introduction to Geometry  
- Introduction to Number Theory  
- Introduction to Counting & Probability  

ðŸ”— [AoPS Introductory Curriculum](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/list/all-products)  

- **Textbooks** provide theory, worked examples, exercises, problems, and challenges.  
- **Solution manuals** include full solutions for all exercises, problems, and challenges.  

âš  **Important**: Students who do not use the solution manuals often struggle to understand solutions or make progress. Serious learners should work with both the textbook and the solution manual.  

See below for chapters targeted in I2, which correspond to **ICLT Levels 6â€“10**.

## 3. Timetable (32 weeks, 2 semesters)  
- Each chapter: about **3â€“4 weeks**  
  - Week 1: Read theory, study examples, begin exercises  
  - Week 2: Continue exercises, deepen understanding  
  - Week 3: Work on review problems  
  - Week 4: Attempt challenge problems

## 4. Testing Timeline  
- **Assessment Test (first week):**  
  - Students select a level (L6â€“L10) to be assessed on.  
  - Two 90-minute tests over the first weekend (Saturday and Sunday):  
    + September 6 and September 7  
  - Students register test times using this online form:  
    [Registration for IC Assessment/Level Test](https://forms.gle/enEpBMuf6xjagpVj6)  
  - Purpose: to determine the correct starting level.  

- **Bi-Monthly Level Tests (every 2 months):**  
  - After the assessment, students register for two bi-monthly tests using the same form.  
  - Each level test consists of two 90-minute tests (Saturday and Sunday):  
    + October 18 and October 19  
    + December 13 and December 14  
  - Purpose: to measure progress at the studentâ€™s chosen level.  
  - Test weekends are listed in the official **[Individual Tracks Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YjM0NjZjY2UyMDRiYmQ4Njc1NGJmMTNiMTNkNmRiZTZhYmUyN2QxMDI3MDBlMDU1M2NjZTEyNjlhYzA5MWJjMUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)**.  

All tests are graded with detailed comments and recommendations.  
Optional Sunday live review sessions are available after tests (students must register):  
  + September 14  
  + October 26  
  + December 21

## 5. Targets  
- Each student must **set personal IC Level goals**, choosing which of Levels 6â€“10 to complete within the year.  
- By the end of I2, students should be confident in:  
  - solving multi-step problems  
  - connecting different strategies across algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics  
  - writing clear and logical solutions to contest-style problems  
- Success in I2 prepares students to advance into **Team Training Tracks (T1/T2)**, where collaborative learning begins.
