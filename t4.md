# T4 – Team Track Level 4

## 1. What it is / Who it’s for  
T4 is the **capstone track** for students training at the highest olympiad level.  
Students work in **teams of 2** (teams of 3 only with approval) and tackle **full olympiad-level problems** requiring mastery of techniques, creativity, and sustained endurance.  
This track is for students who:  
- have successfully completed T3 (or equivalent),  
- are capable of solving challenging olympiad problems independently,  
- are aiming for national olympiads, team selection exams, or the IMO, and  
- can commit **7–8 hours per week**.  

The focus is on mastery: developing advanced techniques, polishing solution writing to professional standards, and training for **multi-hour contests**.

## 2. Curriculum  
Students in T4 continue with the club's textbook: **_The Art of Mathematical Combat – Advanced Problem Solving for Olympians_**, with emphasis on mastery-level work.  

The curriculum emphasizes:  
- Mastery of classical olympiad topics (geometry, algebra, number theory, combinatorics),  
- Learning advanced tools, theorems, and olympiad “tricks”,  
- Writing solutions with precision and clarity for formal grading,  
- Strategic thinking for multi-problem test sets,  
- Training for endurance and time management in multi-hour contests.  

Assignments are fewer but deeper, designed to simulate olympiad exam conditions.

## 3. Timetable (32 weeks, 2 semesters)  
T4 runs on a **repeating 2-week cycle**, similar to T3, but with longer tests and heavier emphasis on endurance.  

- **Week 1**  
  (from the very first cycle)  
  - Begin new material: study assigned theory and examples.  
  - Work on team assignments and submit by Sunday.  

  (from Cycle 2 onwards, i.e. starting Week 3)  
  - Grading and feedback from the previous cycle’s test are shared (Monday–Thursday).  
  - Official test solutions are released on Monday.  
  - Selected teams prepare and present their solutions on Friday or Sunday.  
  - Begin new material: study assigned theory and examples.  
  - Work on team assignments and submit by Sunday.  

- **Week 2**  
  - Monday: Official solutions of the assignment released.  
  - Teams carefully review solutions.  
  - Saturday/Sunday: **Team Test** (4 olympiad problems, 270 minutes). One rigorous solution per problem is submitted jointly by the team.  

Over **32 weeks (16 cycles)**, teams complete 16 intensive units of olympiad-level preparation.

## 4. Testing Timeline  
- **Team Assignments**: submitted every 2 weeks.  
- **Team Tests**:  
  - 270 minutes, 4 full olympiad problems.  
  - Register your test time here: [Registration for Team Tests](https://forms.gle/j4xapHha1oJiMviW9).  
  - Taken bi-weekly on Saturday or Sunday.  
  - Test schedule available here: [Team Tracks (T1–2–3–4) – MCC 2025–2026 Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YTFjMTNlNGEyY2M3NjdjNGRlYjYzNTMwMTk4NzRlNmIwNDQxOGZjYTEzOWQ1ZTRiOWM5OGJjOWI3NWViMmFkMUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).  

- **Grading & Feedback**:  
  - Tests are graded with full olympiad-style feedback.  
  - Selected teams present their solutions live at the Sunday session (or submit a pre-recorded video if both members are absent).

## 5. Targets  
By the end of T4, students should be able to:  
- Solve olympiad-level problems across all four major areas,  
- Use advanced theorems, methods, and problem-solving strategies with confidence,  
- Write formal solutions at national/international olympiad standard,  
- Manage time and stamina in **4.5-hour contests**,  
- Collaborate strategically with a teammate under exam conditions.  

Graduates of T4 are fully prepared for **national olympiads, team selection tests, and international contests (including IMO-level)**.
