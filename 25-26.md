## A. Individual Tracks

### **I1.**

This is the entry point into serious mathematical problem-solving. Students begin learning how to carefully read problem statements, recognize key ideas, and take systematic first steps. The track follows the Art of Problem Solving Introductory Curriculum (Algebra, Counting & Probability, Geometry, and Number Theory). The focus is on building a strong foundation: understanding concepts, practicing all types of exercises, and starting to write clear, step-by-step solutions.

### **I2.**

This track continues and deepens the work of I1. Students now handle problems with more steps and slightly higher complexity. The emphasis is on developing independence in problem-solving, gaining speed, and tackling challenge problems beyond the basics. By the end of I2, students are expected to be comfortable with the full AoPS Introductory series and prepared to transition into the first level of contest training.

## B. Team Tracks

### **T1.**

This is the entry point into collaborative contest training. Students begin working in pairs (or teams of three with approval) and learn how to approach multi-step, contest-style problems. The emphasis is on teamwork: discussing ideas, structuring full solutions together, and learning from mistakes. T1 bridges the Introductory Curriculum into team-based contest preparation, helping students gain confidence in reasoning, writing, and presenting solutions.

### **T2.**

At this level, teams tackle more demanding contest problems across algebra, number theory, combinatorics, and geometry. Students are expected to see connections between ideas, sustain longer arguments, and improve their proof-writing skills. The problems are comparable to AMC10/12 and early national contest qualifiers. T2 emphasizes persistence, strategy, and collaboration as teams learn to refine solutions under time limits.

### **T3.**

This track trains students for national olympiad-level problem solving. Problems now require deeper insight, standard olympiad theorems, and creative synthesis across multiple areas. Teams practice breaking down unfamiliar problems, planning approaches, and writing rigorous, complete solutions. T3 emphasizes flexibility in strategy, clarity of explanation, and collaborative review â€” all key skills for higher-level contests.

Follow [Team Three](./t3.md) for more information.

### **T4.**

The most advanced training level, for teams already capable of solving olympiad problems. The focus is on mastery: learning advanced techniques, polishing solution writing to the highest standard, and developing stamina for multi-hour contests. Students are guided to think strategically about whole problem sets, manage time effectively, and present solutions at the level expected in international olympiads. T4 is the preparation ground for those aiming at the IMO level and beyond.
