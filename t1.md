# T1 – Team Track Level 1

## 1. What it is / Who it’s for  
T1 is the entry point into **collaborative contest training**.  

Students work in **teams of 2** (or 3 with approval) and learn how to tackle multi-step, contest-style math problems.  

This track is for students who:  
- have completed I1/I2 (or equivalent) and want to experience contest-style training,  
- enjoy discussing problems with peers, and  
- can commit **5–7 hours per week**.  

The focus is on teamwork, learning to organize ideas, writing full solutions, and avoiding common mistakes. T1 helps students bridge from the Introductory Curriculum into structured contest preparation.

## 2. Curriculum  
Students in T1 follow the club's textbook: **_From Curiosity to Confidence – Building Foundations for Young Problem Solvers_**  

The curriculum emphasizes:  
- Understanding problem statements clearly,  
- Identifying goals and choosing strategies,  
- Building step-by-step solutions,  
- Reviewing and checking answers together as a team.  

Problems are grouped into smaller sub-questions to teach systematic thinking.

## 3. Timetable (32 weeks, 2 semesters)  
T1 runs on a **repeating 2-week cycle**. Each cycle blends new learning with review of the previous cycle’s test.  

- **Week 1**  
  (from the very first cycle)  
  - Begin new material: study assigned theory and examples.  
  - Work on team assignments and submit by Sunday.  

  (from Cycle 2 onwards, i.e. starting Week 3)  
  - Monday: Official solutions of the assignment released.  
  - Official test solutions are released on Monday.  
  - Grading and feedback from the previous cycle’s test are shared (Monday–Thursday).  
  - Selected teams prepare and present their solutions on Friday or Sunday.  

- **Week 2**  
  - Monday: Official solutions of the assignment released.  
  - Teams carefully review solutions.  
  - Saturday/Sunday: **Team Test** (4 problems, 90 minutes). One solution per problem is submitted jointly by the team.  

Over **32 weeks (16 cycles)**, teams cover about 16 chapters of the curriculum.

## 4. Testing Timeline  
- **Team Assignments**: submitted every 2 weeks.  
- **Team Tests**:  
  - 90 minutes, 4 problems.  
  - Register your test time here: [Registration for Team Tests](https://forms.gle/j4xapHha1oJiMviW9).  
  - Taken bi-weekly on Sunday.  
  - Test schedule available here: [Team Tracks (T1–2–3–4) – MCC 2025–2026 Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YTFjMTNlNGEyY2M3NjdjNGRlYjYzNTMwMTk4NzRlNmIwNDQxOGZjYTEzOWQ1ZTRiOWM5OGJjOWI3NWViMmFkMUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).  

- **Grading & Feedback**:  
  - All tests and assignments are graded with comments.  
  - Selected teams present their solutions live at the Sunday session (or submit a pre-recorded video if both members are absent).

## 5. Targets  
By the end of T1, students should be able to:  
- Read, analyze, and understand contest-style math problems.  
- Develop systematic approaches and write complete, step-by-step solutions.  
- Work effectively as a team: discussing ideas, dividing tasks, checking solutions.  
- Gain confidence in presenting solutions and receiving feedback.  

Successful T1 students are prepared to advance to **T2**, where they will face more challenging problems comparable to AMC 8/10 and national qualifiers.
